# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

**What is JavaScript?**

JavaScript is an object oreiented programming language that is used to create interactive effects within web browsers. It is a scripting language that allows one to implement complex features on web pages e.g timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. It is the third layer of the building blocks of standard web technologies.

# Concepts Learned:
- How to run a JavaScript script.
- How to creating variable and constants
- The differences between var, const, and let.
  **NB:** Both var and let can be used for variable declaration in JavaScript but the difference between them is:
  - var is function scoped while let is block scoped.
  - Variable declared by let cannot be redeclared. It must also be declared before use (i.e before assigning a value to it).
  - However, variables declared with var keyword are hoisted.
  **JavaScript Hoisting:** refers to the process in which the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.
  - const is used to declare unchanging or constant variables.
- Data types in JavaScript: Number, String, BigInt, Array, Boolean, Undefined, Symbol. *NB: JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types.*
- How to use if, if ... else statements
- How to use comments. It uses a similar comment style as C programming language.
- How to affect values to variables. (e.g let a = 10; let b; b = a;)
- How to use while and for loops
- How to use break and continue statements.
- What is a function and how do you use functions. Anonymous functions and arrow functions.
- What does a function that does not use any return statement return? (undefined)
- Scope of variables.
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- How to manipulate dictionary
- How to import a file.
