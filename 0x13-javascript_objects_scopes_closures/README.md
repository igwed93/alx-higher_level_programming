# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures
JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language, and what makes it more amazing to implement is that it's quite similar to other object-oriented programming languages like Python. In addition, just as in python, everything in JavaScript is an object.

**Concepts Learned:**
- creating an object in JavaScript: In simple terms, an object is created the moment you instantiate any variable in JavaScript. To be more explicit, objects can be created in JavaScript by initializing various key-value pairs enclosed in curly brackets to a variable.

- **this**: the this keyword works like the self keyword of Python in the definition of a class. **this** is used as a reference to the instance of a class or to an object itself.

- **undefined**: undefined is a type in JavaScript. A variable that has not been assigned is of the type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.

- **variable scope**: the scope of a variable determines its accessibility or visibility. JavaScript has three  scopes, namely: **Block scope; Function scope; Global scope**

- **closure**: A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.

- **prototype**: Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another. Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its **prototype**. The prototype itself is an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.

- objects inherit from another object using the extend keyword in JavaScript.
